## Welcome to the newly-formed Irish chapter of the <font color="#2DC26B">Walter E. Dandy Neurosurgical Society</font>


Honoring the legacy of the pioneering neurosurgeon Walter Dandy, this student-run project aims to provide a nationwide hub for medical students who wish to pursue careers in brain, spine, or peripheral nerve surgery. 

We also welcome students who feel aligned towards related disciplines — like neurology, critical care, orthopaedic / plastic / maxillofacial surgery, interventional radiology, or anaesthesia. 

### Via the <font color="#2DC26B">Dandy Ireland</font> platform, students can:

- Join an online community and interact with likeminded students;
- learn about the process / career path needed to become a neurosurgeon in Ireland;
- meet potential mentors and build up professional connections within the Irish healthcare system;
- be made aware of ongoing studies / research projects looking to recruit students, contribute to clinical research and become a co-author on scientific publications;
- attend local events (e.g. webinars, job-talks, journal clubs, speed-mentoring nights, neurosurgical skills workshops);
- learn about and attend international conferences as an Irish representative — allowing the chance to build relationships with students and professionals from around the world, plus exposure to new ideas / techniques, and opportunities to present your research to an international audience.
